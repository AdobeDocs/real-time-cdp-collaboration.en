# Discover overlaps and compare audiences

After creating a project within a collaboration space between an advertiser and a publisher, you can now compare your audiences against your collaborator's audiences. Thereby, you can discover overlaps between audiences and get insights broken down by match keys or identities. This helps advertisers decide which audiences to share with publishers for activation, depending on the desired use case.

The match keys are set when you connect with a publisher. To change the overlaps percentages indicated in preparation for running campaigns, you can remove match keys but you cannot add new match keys. To do that, head to the connection settings between the collaborators (add link here).

* [Connected](/help/guide/connect-publisher-advertiser/establishing-connections.md) with a desired advertiser or publisher
* [Created a project](/help/guide/collaborate/manage-projects.md) between you and a collaborator

* One of your audiences against one of your collaborator's audiences
* One of your audiences against all of your collaborator's audiences
* All your audiences against all of your collaborator's audiences
* All your audiences against one of your collaborator's audiences

The information displayed relates to:

|Metric | Description |
|---------|----------|
| Identity count (yours) | B1 |
| Identity count (your collaborator) | B2 |
| Overlapping identities | B3 |
| Overlap percentage | B2 |
| Identities breakdown by match key | B3 |

## Recommended audiences {#recommended-audiences}

The **[!UICONTROL Recommended audiences]** view in the **[!UICONTROL Discover]** module provides a curated list of the top five recommended audiences based on overlap percentage. This feature helps you quickly identify the audiences with the highest overlap with your current data, enabling you to target your campaigns more effectively.

For extensive information about the overlapping identities count and percentages, read the [overlap calculations reference documentation](/help/guide/reference/overlap-calculations.md).
