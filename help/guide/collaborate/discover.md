# Discover overlaps

After creating a project within a collaboration space between an advertiser and a publisher, you can discover overlaps between your and your collaborator's audiences

The match keys are set when you connect with a publisher. To change the overlaps percentages indicated in preparation for running campaigns, you can remove match keys but you cannot add new match keys. To do that, head to the connection settings between the collaborators (add link here).
