# Activate audiences

>[!AVAILABILITY]
>
>Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform (CDP) Collaboration is currently a beta product, available to select customers. The product and documentation are subject to change. Contact your Adobe representative to learn more.

As a publisher, discover how to activate audiences using Adobe Real-Time CDP Collaboration. Currently, you can activate audiences to Amazon S3 locations. Additional activation channels are planned.

Only *publisher organizations* can activate audiences for campaigns. Advertiser organizations can [share audiences](/help/guide/collaborate/share.md) with publishers, who will activate these audiences in projects. Read more about the [end-to-end workflow](/help/guide/end-to-end-workflow.md) for advertisers and publishers.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

As a publisher using Real-Time CDP Collaboration, you must first work with the Adobe enablement and engineering team to set up a connection to your desired Amazon S3 location. Once this is set up, you are able to activate, or export, audiences from Real-Time CDP Collaboration to your Amazon S3 location. Contact your Adobe representative to kick off this workflow.

## Activation behavior {#activation-behavior}

After your advertiser connection shares an audience for activation, this audience immediately shows up in your **[!UICONTROL Activate]** view. The audience will be exported to your indicated location at the interval set by the advertiser in their audience share screen.

After activating data and running campaigns, work with the Adobe enablement and engineering team to upload measurement data and view the corresponding [measurement reports](/help/guide/collaborate/measure.md).
