# Create and manage projects

{{limited-availability-release-note}}

Projects are the centerpiece of your workflow in Adobe Real-Time CDP Collaboration. After connecting with collaborators, create a project to run audience overlap calculations and discover relevant audiences for campaigns.

>[!TIP]
>
>Projects should generally be associated with a single campaign.

You can use filters to view only the projects that you have started with certain collaborators, as shown below:

## Create project {#create-project}

>id="rtcdp_collaboration_create_project_advertisername_amc"
>title="Advertiser name (Amazon Marketing Cloud)"
>abstract="For Amazon Marketing Cloud (AMC) connections, this field represents the AMC instance your Amazon Ads login has access to. It does not reflect an advertiser name. If the required instance isn't listed, contact your Amazon Marketing Cloud administrator to request access."

To create a project, you must first [establish a connection](/help/guide/connect/establishing-connections.md) with a collaborator. Once the connection is established, you can create a project with that collaborator.

>[!CONTEXTUALHELP]
>id="rtcdp_collaboration_manage_projects_advertisername"
>title="Advertiser Name"
>abstract="Select the advertiser name from the dropdown menu. The options are pre-configured by the publisher in the connection settings to ensure compatibility with their systems."

Navigate to **[!UICONTROL Collaborate]** and then **[!UICONTROL My Projects]**. If this is your first project, you can select **[!UICONTROL Create a project]**. Otherwise you can select the add icon (![Add icon.](/help/assets/icons/plus.png)) to create a new project at anytime.

![Select plus symbol or Create a project to set up a new project.](/help/assets/collaborate/manage-view-projects/create-project.png){zoomable="yes"}

The **[!UICONTROL Create project]** dialog appears. Select the **[!UICONTROL Collaborator]** you are creating the project with via the dropdown. If you're a publisher and you set advertiser names during your connection setup, you can select the **[!UICONTROL Advertiser name]**. 

>[!NOTE]
>
> If you configured a single advertiser name in the connection settings, it appears by default. If no advertiser name was set up, the advertiser's **[!UICONTROL Name]** is preselected as the **[!UICONTROL Advertiser name]**.

![Create project dialog with collaborator selected and advertiser name highlighted.](/help/assets/collaborate/manage-view-projects/create-project-advertiser-names.png){zoomable="yes"}

Next, add a **[!UICONTROL Project name]** and **[!UICONTROL Description]** for your project. Then, select an image to represent the project. This image helps to distinguish the project in the project overview page. Once you're done, select **[!UICONTROL Create]** to create the project.

![Required options to set up a new project](/help/assets/collaborate/manage-view-projects/create-project-required-info.png){zoomable="yes"}

You can now view your new project, its details, and available sections based on the use cases selected during connection setup.
