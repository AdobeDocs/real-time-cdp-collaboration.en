# Create and manage projects

{{limited-availability-release-note}}

Projects are the centerpiece of your workflow in Real-Time CDP Collaboration. After you discover and connect with the collaborators that you want to work with, it's time to create a project. Use the project space to run overlap calculations to compare your audiences with your collaborator's audiences and discover relevant audiences that you can use in campaigns. Audiences are then shared between collaborators, activated by publishers, and both parties can then view measurement reports about audience performance.

>[!TIP]
>
>Projects should generally be associated with a single campaign.

You can use filters to view only the projects that you have started with certain collaborators, as shown below:

You can now view your new project and its details.

## Project use cases {#project-use-cases}

Drill into individual projects to run overlap reports, discover and share audiences with your collaborator, and view measurement information. To view extensive information about these areas that form an individual project, select **[!UICONTROL View]**. The project surface consists of up to four sections, each offering you a rich set of options and controls. Available project sections depend on the use cases selected in the connection process, as follows:

| Use case | Project section |
| --- | --- |
| Campaign measurement | This use case grants access to the [Measure](/help/guide/collaborate/measure.md) section and all availabile functionality. |
| Audience discovery | This use case grants access to the [Discover](/help/guide/collaborate/discover.md) section and all availabile functionality. |
| Audience sharing and activation | This use case grants access to the [Share](/help/guide/collaborate/share.md) and [Activate](/help/guide/collaborate/activate.md) (publisher-only) sections and all availabile functionality. |
