# Create and manage projects

{{limited-availability-release-note}}

Projects are the centerpiece of your workflow in Real-Time CDP Collaboration. After connecting with collaborators, create a project to run audience overlap calculations and discover relevant audiences for campaigns.

>[!TIP]
>
>Projects should generally be associated with a single campaign.

You can use filters to view only the projects that you have started with certain collaborators, as shown below:

>title="Advertiser Name"
>abstract="Select the advertiser name from the dropdown menu. The options are pre-configured by the publisher in the connection settings to ensure compatibility with their systems."

Navigate to **[!UICONTROL Collaborate]** and then **[!UICONTROL My Projects]**. If this is your first project, you can select **[!UICONTROL Create a project]**. Otherwise you can select the add icon (![Add icon.](/help/assets/icons/plus.png)) to create a new project at anytime.

![Select plus symbol or Create a project to set up a new project.](/help/assets/collaborate/manage-view-projects/create-project.png){zoomable="yes"}

The **[!UICONTROL Create project]** dialog appears. Select the **[!UICONTROL Collaborator]** you are creating the project with via the dropdown. If you're a publisher and you set advertiser names during your connection setup, you can select the **[!UICONTROL Advertiser name]**. 

>[!NOTE]
>
> If you configured a single advertiser name in the connection settings, it appears by default. If no advertiser name was set up, the advertiser's **[!UICONTROL Name]** is preselected as the **[!UICONTROL Advertiser name]**.

![Create project dialog with collaborator selected and advertiser name highlighted.](/help/assets/collaborate/manage-view-projects/create-project-advertiser-names.png){zoomable="yes"}

Next, add a **[!UICONTROL Project name]** and **[!UICONTROL Description]** for your project. Then, select an image to represent the project. This image helps to distinguish the project in the project overview page. Once you're done, select **[!UICONTROL Create]** to create the project.

You can now view your new project, its details, and available sections based on the use cases selected during connection setup.
