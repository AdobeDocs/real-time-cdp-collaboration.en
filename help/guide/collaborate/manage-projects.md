# Create and manage projects

>[!AVAILABILITY]

>Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform (CDP) Collaboration is currently an alpha product, available to select customers. Contact your Adobe representative to learn more. 

Projects are the centerpiece of your workflow in Real-Time CDP Collaboration. After you have discovered the collaborators that you want to work with, it's time to create a project. The project is the space where you will be running overlap calculations to compare your and your collaborators' audiences, where audiences are then shared between collaborators, activated by publishers, and where finally both parties can view measurement reports about audience performances.

You can use filters to only view the projects that you have started with certain collaborators, as shown below:

## Create project

To create a project, select the + symbol in the upper right corner. Next, select one or more objectives for your project. Provide a name and description for your project and confirm your selection.

You can now view your new project and information about it. Next, you can start running overlap calculations between your and your collaborator's audiences.

## View individual projects

Drill into individual projects to run overlap reports, discover audiences, share these audiences with your collaborator, and view measurement information. 

To view extensive information about these areas that form an individual project, select **[!UICONTROL View]**. The project surface consists of three sections, each offering you a myriad of options and controls. These are detailed in the following documentation pages:

* [Discover](/help/guide/collaborate/discover.md)
* [Share](/help/guide/collaborate/share.md)
* Activate (publisher-only)
* [Measure](/help/guide/collaborate/measure.md)
