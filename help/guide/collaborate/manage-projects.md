Projects are the centerpiece of your workflow in Real-Time CDP Collaboration. After you discover the collaborators that you want to work with, it's time to create a project. Use the project space to run overlap calculations to compare your audiences with your collaborators'. Audiences are then shared between collaborators, activated by publishers and both parties can then view measurement reports about audience performance.

You can use filters to only view the projects that you have started with certain collaborators, as shown below:

## Create project {#create-project}

To create a project, select the + symbol in the upper right corner. Next, select one or more objectives for your project. Provide a name and description for your project and confirm your selection.

You can now view your new project and its details. Next, you can start running overlap calculations between your and your collaborator's audiences.

## View individual projects

Drill into individual projects to run overlap reports, discover and share audiences with your collaborator, and view measurement information.

To view extensive information about these areas that form an individual project, select **[!UICONTROL View]**. The project surface consists of three sections, each offering you a myriad of options and controls. These are detailed in the following documentation pages:

* [Discover](/help/guide/collaborate/discover.md)
* [Share](/help/guide/collaborate/share.md)
* [Activate](/help/guide/collaborate/activate.md) (publisher-only)
* [Measure](/help/guide/collaborate/measure.md)
