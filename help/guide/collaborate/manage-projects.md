# Create and manage projects

{{limited-availability-release-note}}

Projects are the centerpiece of your workflow in Real-Time CDP Collaboration. After you discover and connect with the collaborators that you want to work with, it's time to create a project. Use the project space to run overlap calculations to compare your audiences with your collaborator's audiences and discover relevant audiences that you can use in campaigns. Audiences are then shared between collaborators, activated by publishers, and both parties can then view measurement reports about audience performance.

>[!TIP]
>
>Projects should generally be associated with a single campaign.

You can use filters to view only the projects that you have started with certain collaborators, as shown below:

## Create project {#create-project}

To create a project, select the Plus **+** symbol in the upper right corner. Or, if this is your first project, navigate to **[!UICONTROL Collaborate]** > **[!UICONTROL My Projects]**, and select **[!UICONTROL Create a project]**.

![Select plus symbol or Create a project to set up a new project.](/help/assets/collaborate/manage-view-projects/create-project.png)

Next, select the collaborator that you are creating the project with. Provide a **[!UICONTROL project name]** and **[!UICONTROL description]** for your project, select an image header to easily distinguish the project, and confirm your selection.

You can now view your new project and its details. Next, use the [Discover](/help/guide/collaborate/discover.md) tab to start running overlap calculations between your and your collaborator's audiences.

## View individual projects and next steps

Drill into individual projects to run overlap reports, discover and share audiences with your collaborator, and view measurement information.

To view extensive information about these areas that form an individual project, select **[!UICONTROL View]**. The project surface consists of three sections, each offering you a rich set of options and controls. These are detailed in the following documentation pages:

* [Discover](/help/guide/collaborate/discover.md)
* [Share](/help/guide/collaborate/share.md)
* [Activate](/help/guide/collaborate/activate.md) (publisher-only)
* [Measure](/help/guide/collaborate/measure.md)
