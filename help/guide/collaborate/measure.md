Learn about the available reports in Real-Time CDP Collaboration and understand how to measure and analyze the performance of your marketing campaigns across various channels.

To view the campaign reports, navigate to **[!UICONTROL Collaborate]**, select your desired project, and select the **[!UICONTROL Measure]** tab within the project. 

Select **[!UICONTROL View full report]** to access the various available reports, detailed further below.

## Prerequisites

Before you can access the measurement reports in Real-Time CDP Collaboration, you have already:

* [Connected](/help/guide/connect-publisher-advertiser/establishing-connections.md) with a desired advertiser or publisher and started collaborating on [projects](/help/guide/collaborate/manage-projects.md).
* Run a campaign and [uploaded measurement data](/help/guide/setup/onboard-measurement-data.md) into Real-Time CDP Collaboration.

## Summary view

The top-of-page view in the measurement tab shows a campaign summary with some high-level numbers for you to reference:

**[!UICONTROL Impressions]**: the total number of times that the creative was displayed. 
**[!UICONTROL Unique reach]**: the number of individual identities who have seen the creative.
**[!UICONTROL Total average frequency]**: The number of impressions divided by unique identities reached. Indicates how often every identity was displayed the creative.

## Daily impressions

Use the daily impressions view to understand the total number of impressions displayed for your creative throughout the period of the campaign.

## Frequency distribution

Use the frequency distribution view to understand the breakdown of how many impressions were shown to each unique user. This view can help you in future campaigns to decide as of which point you want to suppress audiences. For example, you may want to suppress profiles who have already seen a creative three times.

## Cumulative reach curve

As the campaign progressed and the number of impressions went up, understand whether the number of users that you were able to reach has also grown. A common pattern in campaigns is that after a certain point a plateau is reached where the creative is displayed to the same people over and over again. This view can help you adjust the length of future campaigns, depending on the moment that new people were not being reached anymore.
