# Collaborate overview

{{limited-availability-release-note}}

After forming a connection with a collaborator, you can create a project to begin collaborating. Projects are the heart of Real-Time CDP Collaboration, enabling you to run audience overlap calculations, discover relevant audiences, activate audiences in your advertising platforms, and measure campaign performance. Available functionality within a project depends on the use cases selected during the connection setup.

## Project use cases {#project-use-cases}

The project overview displays the use cases selected during the connection setup. These use cases define the functionality available in the project. The use cases are:

| Use case | Project section |
| --- | --- |
| Campaign measurement | This use case grants access to the [Measure](/help/guide/collaborate/measure.md) section and all available functionality. |
| Audience discovery | This use case grants access to the [Discover](/help/guide/collaborate/discover.md) section and all available functionality. |
| Audience activation | This use case grants access to the [Activate](/help/guide/collaborate/activate.md) section and all available functionality. |
