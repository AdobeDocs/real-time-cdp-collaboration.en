# Share audiences

>[!AVAILABILITY]
>
>Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform (CDP) Collaboration is currently an alpha product, available to select customers. Contact your Adobe representative to learn more. 

## Share new audiences

This module is work in progress.

## View currently shared audiences

In the Sharing tab, you can view the audiences that are currently being shared between the collaborators, grouped together in audience sharing modules. 

![Overview of the sharing tab.](/help/assets/collaborate/share/share-tab-overview.png)

The banner at the top of the page shows figures across all audience sharing modules. Within each audience sharing module, you can get information about each shared audience. 

|Metric | Description |
|---------|----------|
| **[!UICONTROL Identity count]** | Indicates the number of profiles across all identities tied to this audience, as per the latest identity count evaluation. These numbers are refreshed [TODO: HOW OFTEN ARE THESE NUMBERS REFRESHED] |
| **[!UICONTROL Overlapping identities]** | Indicates the number of overlapping identities between the members of this audience and the total population of profiles across the collaborator's inventory. |
| **[!UICONTROL Match key breakdown]** | Shows the identity count for each identity used in the audience. For example, a total identity count of 500k users might consist of 400k users keyed off the hashed email identity and 100k users keyed off a mobile ID identity. Note that the same person might be present in the audience twice in this case with their email and mobile ID identities. |
| **[!UICONTROL Objective]** | **[!UICONTROL Suppress]** or **[!UICONTROL Target]**. Indicates if the members of an audience should be targeted or excluded from campaigns. |

The page also provides controls for you to **[!UICONTROL Pause sharing]** and **[!UICONTROL Edit audiences]**.

|Metric | Description |
|---------|----------|
| **[!UICONTROL Shared audiences]** | Indicates the number of audiences shared between collaborators in this project, across all audience sharing modules. |
| **[!UICONTROL Estimated addressable reach]** | Indicates the approximate number of profiles that you can reach across all the audiences that are currently shared in the project. [TODO: ADD INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THIS IS CALCULATED] |
| **[!UICONTROL Target identities]** | The number of identities across all audiences shared in this project for which you selected to target the profiles. |
| **[!UICONTROL Suppress identities]** | The number of identities across all audiences shared in this project for which you selected to suppress the profiles and thereby not target them in campaigns. |

## Edit audiences

Select **[!UICONTROL Edit audiences]** to change with audiences are shared in an audience sharing module, as well as to change several configurations related to how audiences are being shared.

![View of the edit audiences modal](/help/assets/collaborate/share/edit-audiences-modal.png)

Search for audiences that you want to add to the sharing module. 

For each audience, you can select whether you'd like to target or suppress those profiles in campaigns. 

To remove an audience from the sharing module, select the trash can icon [TODO: add spectrum icon and folder].

Select how often you would like the audience membership to be refreshed and the date range within which you want the membership of the audience to be refreshed. 

TODO: are there any limitations for frequency in the M1 release?
