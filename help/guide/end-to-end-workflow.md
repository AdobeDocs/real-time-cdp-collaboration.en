>Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform (CDP) Collaboration is currently an alpha product, available to select customers. Contact your Adobe representative to learn more. 

Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform (CDP) Collaboration allows advertisers and publishers to collaborate on campaigns in a privacy-first manner. Read this page to understand the workflow to get the most out of the product, as an advertiser or publisher.

## Advertiser end-to-end workflow {#advertiser}

As an advertiser, start by [onboarding your company](/help/guide/setup/onboard-organization.md) onto Real-Time CDP Collaboration. Use the [setup page](/help/guide/setup/setup-overview.md) to edit your company settings, add your preferred match keys that you will be working with, and decide which data to bring in. In the first release, the product allows you to import audiences from Real-Time CDP only. 

![Discover, share, measure for advertisers.](/help/assets/end-to-end-workflow/discover-share-measure.png)

Use the [discover tab to find publishers](/help/guide/connect-publisher-advertiser/discover-publishers.md) that you want to work with for campaigns. Contact the publisher and discuss collaboration terms outside of the product. Once agreed on a set of terms, you can [send a connection invite](/help/guide/connect-publisher-advertiser/establishing-connections.md) to connect with the publisher.

After the publisher accepts your connection request, it is time to explore the overlapping audiences between your organization and theirs. Set up a project for a campaign and [run extensive overlap reports](/help/guide/collaborate/discover.md) to discover the best audiences for your next advertising campaign, depending on the collaboration use case - targeting, suppression, and others. 

Once you discovered the ideal audiences, it is time to [share them with the publisher](/help/guide/collaborate/share.md) and they will activate them and thereby kick off the campaign. 

The final step in the collaboration loop is [measurement](/help/guide/collaborate/measure.md). To measure business results, you will want to know how your campaigns did. For that purpose, you will upload extensive measurement data like ad logs and then run the reports provided in the program to understand how your audiences performed. 

## Publisher end-to-end workflow {#publisher}

As a publisher, start by onboarding your company onto Real-Time CDP Collaboration. Use the setup page to edit various company settings. For example, make sure to include the identities that your company works with. 

Decide which audience data to import and which audiences to make discoverable and viewable to the advertisers who looking to connect with you in the **[!UICONTROL Connect]** area of the product. In the first release, the product only allows you to bring in data from Real-Time CDP. 

As you import audiences into Real-Time CDP Collaboration, make sure to tag and categorize the audiences. Real-Time CDP follows the established IAB taxonomy for categorizing audiences.

Extend a publisher invite to advertisers that you would like to collaborate with on your properties. Contact the publisher and discuss collaboration terms outside of the product. Once agreed on a set of terms, wait for the advertiser to extend a formal connection invite to connect with you. Generally, you should also monitor pending connection requests from advertiser brands who are looking to work with you on campaigns. Review the connection settings proposed by your potential collaborator and agree or amend those before starting the collaboration.

After you accept their connection request, it is time to explore the overlapping audiences between you and your collaborator. The advertiser will set up a project for a campaign and run extensive overlap reports between their audiences and yours, based on their desired objectives - prospecting, suppression, and more.  

Once the advertiser discovered the ideal audiences to target for a campaign, they will share these with you and you can activate them and thereby kick off the campaign. 

The final step in the collaboration loop is measurement. You will want to know how your campaigns did, so the final step is to upload extensive measurement data like ad logs and then run the reports provided in the program to understand how the audiences performed.
