>Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform (CDP) Collaboration is currently an alpha product, available to select customers. Contact your Adobe representative to learn more. 

Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform (CDP) Collaboration allows advertisers and publishers to collaborate on campaigns in a privacy-first manner. Read this page to understand the workflow to get the most out of the product, as an advertiser or publisher

## Advertiser end-to-end

As an advertiser, start by [onboarding your company](/help/guide/setup/onboard-organization.md) onto Real-Time CDP Collaboration. Use the [setup page](/help/guide/setup/setup-overview.md) to edit your company settings, add your preferred match keys that you will be working with, and decide which data to bring in. In the first release, the product allows you to import audiences from Real-Time CDP only.

Use the [discover tab to find publishers](/help/guide/connect-publisher-advertiser/discover-publishers.md) that you want to work with for campaigns. Contact the publisher and discuss collaboration terms outside of the product. Once agreed on a set of terms, you can extend a formal connection invite to connect with the publisher.

After the publisher accepts your connection request, it is time to explore the overlapping audiences between you and them. Set up a project for a campaign and [run extensive overlap reports](/help/guide/collaborate/discover.md) to discover the best audiences, depending on the collaboration use case - targeting, suppression, and others. 

Once you discovered the ideal audiences, it is time to [share these with the publisher](/help/guide/collaborate/share.md) and they will activate them and thereby kick off the campaign. 

The final step in the collaboration loop is [measurement](/help/guide/collaborate/measure.md). You will want to know how your campaigns did, so the final step is to upload extensive measurement data like ad logs and then run the reports provided in the program to understand how your audiences performed. 

## Publisher end-to-end

As a publisher, start by onboarding your company onto Real-Time CDP Collaboration. Use the setup page to edit your company settings, and decide which audience data to bring in. In the first release, the product only allows you to bring in data from Real-Time CDP. 

Extend a publisher invite to advertisers that you would like to collaborate with on your properties. Contact the publisher and discuss collaboration terms outside of the product. Once agreed on a set of terms, wait for the advertiser to extend a formal connection invite to connect with you.

After you accept their connection request, it is time to explore the overlapping audiences between you and them. The advertiser will set up a project for a campaign and run extensive overlap reports between their audiences and yours, based on the desired use case. 

Once the advertiser discovered the ideal audiences, they will share these with you and you can activate them and thereby kick off the campaign. 

The final step in the collaboration loop is measurement. You will want to know how your campaigns did, so the final step is to upload extensive measurement data like ad logs and then run the reports provided in the program to understand how your audiences performed.
