## Understanding your activity dashboard

The activity dashboard displays a comprehensive list of all credit-consuming operations within your organization. Each row represents a distinct activity and provides key information about the credit usage:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Date | The date when the activity occurred, displayed in MM/DD/YYYY format |
| Connection ID | A unique identifier for each connection, represented as an alphanumeric string |
| Connection name | The name of the collaborator associated with the connection |
| Activity | The type of activity performed, such as **Activation - Sharing**, **Activation - Egress**, or **Audience managenent** |
| Total credits used | The total number of credits consumed by the activity |
| My credit share | Your organization's portion of the credits used for the activity |

## Types of activities

The Activity column shows different types of credit-consuming operations:

* **Activation - Sharing**: Credits consumed during audience sharing activities
* **Activation - Egress**: Credits used when exporting data from the platform
* **Audience managenent**: 

## Manage your credit consumption

To effectively manage your credit consumption:

1. **Monitor regularly**: Check your activity dashboard frequently to understand usage patterns
2. **Track by connection**: Use the connection name to identify which partnerships are consuming the most credits
3. **Analyze activity types**: Understand which activities are using the most credits to optimize your operations
4. **Review credit share**: Compare your credit share against total credits used to understand cost distribution in partnerships

## Pagination and navigation

The activity list is paginated to improve performance and readability. Use the navigation controls at the bottom of the table to move between pages and adjust how many records you can view at once.
