![Discover publishers page](/help/assets/connect/discover-publishers/discover-publishers-overview.png)

## My connections

Use the **[!UICONTROL My connections]** view to understand where any action is required on your side and to get a glimpse of all the publishers that you are connected with. 

Under **[!UICONTROL Action required]**, you can see a list of all connections where an invite has been sent but the connection has not been established yet. An action might be required, from your organization or from the collaborator. 

![Action required view in the My connections screen](/help/assets/connect/discover-publishers/action-required-view.png)

Some reasons why a connection is displayed in the **[!UICONTROL Action required]** view are:

* Your organization has sent a collaboration invite to another organization and you are waiting for them to accept. At this point, you can preview the [connection settings](/help/guide/glossary.md#connection-settings) that you can later submit to the prospective collaborator.
* Your organization has sent a collaboration invite to another organization and they have accepted it. At this point, you can proceed and set up the connection settings and submit them to the collaborator for approval.
* Your organization has sent connection settings to the collaborator and you are waiting on them to accept or reject the proposed connection settings.
* Your organization has sent connection settings to the collaborator and they have rejected your proposal. You can now revise the connection settings and resend. 

In the **[!UICONTROL Existing connections]** view, you can explore existing connections with collaborators and proceed to create projects to start collaborating on campaigns.
