Find out how to discover and connect with potential publishers for collaboration using Adobe Real-Time CDP Collaboration. This guide provides insights on identifying suitable partners and leveraging their audience data to enhance your marketing efforts.

To discover publishers, go to the **[!UICONTROL Connect]** > **[!UICONTROL Discover publishers]** tab.

![Discover publishers page](/help/assets/connect/discover-publishers/discover-publishers-overview.png)

Select **[!UICONTROL View publisher]** to learn more about the publisher, including the match keys and use cases (for example measurement, audience sharing) that they support. You can also view and inspect any public audiences that the publisher has decided to share.

## My connections

Use the **[!UICONTROL My connections]** view to understand where any action is required on your side and to get a glimpse of all the publishers that you are connected with. 

Under **[!UICONTROL Action required]**, you can see a list of all connections where an invite has been sent but the connection has not been established yet. An action might be required, from your organization or from the collaborator. 

![Action required view in the My connections screen](/help/assets/connect/discover-publishers/action-required-view.png)

Some reasons why a connection is displayed in the **[!UICONTROL Action required]** view are:

* Your organization has sent a collaboration invite to another organization and you are waiting for them to accept. At this point, you can preview the [connection settings](/help/guide/glossary.md#connection-settings) that you can later submit to the prospective collaborator.
* Your organization has sent a collaboration invite to another organization and they have accepted it. At this point, you can proceed and set up the connection settings and submit them to the collaborator for approval.
* Your organization has sent connection settings to the collaborator and you are waiting on them to accept or reject the proposed connection settings.
* Your organization has sent connection settings to the collaborator and they have rejected your proposal. You can now revise the connection settings and resend. 

In the **[!UICONTROL Existing connections]** view, you can explore existing connections with collaborators and proceed to create projects to start collaborating on campaigns.
