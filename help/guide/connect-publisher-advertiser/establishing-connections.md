# Set up connection

**Work in progress**

Both publishers and advertisers can set up connections. Whichever party initiates the connection will afterwards be the connection owner. 

## High-level workflow

At a high level, to establish a connection between an advertiser and a publisher, the workflow looks like below:

1. Advertiser discovers publisher 
2. Send connection invite 
3. Publisher accepts the invite 
4. Advertiser sends connection settings including match keys and others
5. Publisher accepts connection settings

Once the items above are completed, the collaborators can proceed to create a project to run overlap reports and kick off advertising campaigns. 

## Send invite

To set up a connection, select **[!UICONTROL Connect]** when browsing the publisher inventory in the discover publishers screen.
