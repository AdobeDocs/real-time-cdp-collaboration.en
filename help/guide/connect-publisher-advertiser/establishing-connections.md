# Connect with advertisers or publishers

Establishing a connection between two parties of a collaboration (most commonly an advertiser and a publisher) is the prerequisite in Real-Time CDP Collaboration to companies working together on campaigns. Publishers and advertisers alike can set up connections. Whichever party initiates the connection will afterwards be the *connection owner*. 

## High-level workflow

At a high level, to establish a connection between an advertiser and a publisher, the workflow looks like below:

1. The advertiser [browses publishers and discovers](/help/guide/connect-publisher-advertiser/discover-publishers.md) one that they would like to work with 
2. The advertiser sends a connection invite.
3. The publisher accepts the invite.
4. The advertiser sends connection settings including match keys and others.
5. The publisher accepts connection settings. If desired, the publisher can reject the initial connection settings and request that the advertiser submits revised connection settings.

Once the items above are completed, the collaborators can proceed to [create a project](/help/guide/collaborate/manage-projects.md#create-project) to [run overlap reports](/help/guide/collaborate/discover.md) and kick off advertising campaigns.

## Send invite

To set up a connection, select **[!UICONTROL Connect]** when browsing the publisher inventory in the discover publishers screen.

![Connect selector](/help/assets/connect/establish-connection/connect-selection.png)

At this point, the invite is out and you can preview the connection settings, but cannot edit them. Once the collaborator accepts the invite, you can configure the connection settings and send them to the collaborator to review and accept.

After the invite is sent and accepted by your collaborator, you can now start setting up the connection settings for the connection. The connection settings define the terms of your collaboration, such as the use cases that you will accomplish together, the match keys that you will use in projects, and more. You can edit and define the fields below:

+++Use cases


Use cases are prefilled with the ones you selected at your organizational level. You can edit the use cases to be used in this connection. Note that for alpha, the use case selection has no effect on your projects.

+++Match keys

Match keys are prefilled with the ones you selected at your organizational level. You can edit the match keys.

![Match keys](/help/assets/connect/establish-connection/edit-match-keys.png)

+++Billing ownership

Billing ownership determines how the costs for the campaigns will be shared between the two collaborating parties. You can edit the billing ownership percentage.

<!--

+++Legal agreement

Verify that a data sharing agreement between the two parties exists.

After you have made your selection, select **[!UICONTROL Submit]** to send the suggested settings to your collaborator.

If you are receiving proposed connection settings from your collaborator, you can either **[!UICONTROL Accept]** or **[!UICONTROL Reject]** those. If you are rejecting connection settings, reach out to your collaborator outside of the product and discuss how they should revise the connection settings for you to accept them.

## Next steps

After establishing a connection with your collaborator, you or your collaborator can now [create projects](/help/guide/collaborate/manage-projects.md#create-project).
