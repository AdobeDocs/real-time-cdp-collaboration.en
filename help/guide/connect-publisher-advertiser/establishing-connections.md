# Set up connection

>[!AVAILABILITY]
>
>Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform (CDP) Collaboration is currently an alpha product, available to select customers. Contact your Adobe representative to learn more. 

Establishing a connection between two parties of a collaboration (most commonly an advertiser and a publisher) is the prerequisite in Real-Time CDP Collaboration to companies working together on campaigns. Publishers and advertisers alike can set up connections. Whichever party initiates the connection will afterwards be the connection owner. 

## High-level workflow

At a high level, to establish a connection between an advertiser and a publisher, the workflow looks like below:

1. Advertiser discovers publisher 
2. Send connection invite 
3. Publisher accepts the invite 
4. Advertiser sends connection settings including match keys and others
5. Publisher accepts connection settings

Once the items above are completed, the collaborators can proceed to create a project to run overlap reports and kick off advertising campaigns. 

## Send invite

To set up a connection, select **[!UICONTROL Connect]** when browsing the publisher inventory in the discover publishers screen.

After the invite is sent, you can now start setting up the connection settings for the connection. You can edit and define the fields below:

If you are receiving proposed connection settings from your collaborator, you can either **[!UICONTROL Accept]** or **[!UICONTROL Reject]** those.
