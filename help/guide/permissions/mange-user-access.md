# Manage user access through Permissions

>[!AVAILABILITY]
>
>Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform (CDP) Collaboration is currently a beta product, available to select customers. The product and documentation are subject to change. Contact your Adobe representative to learn more.

Manage permissions and user access to individual components within Real-Time CDP Collaboration through Experience Cloud's [Permissions UI](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/access-control/abac/permissions-ui/browse). Permissions allows administrators to define [roles](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/access-control/abac/permissions-ui/roles) to manage users access to specific features and resources. 

To access the Permissions UI, you must be an administrator that has a subscription to Adobe Experience Platform. Refer to the sections below to gain access as a system administrator, or to grant access to your team.

## System administrators: grant the necessary permissions for yourself and your role

### Gain access to Experience Platform and Permissions

As a [system administrator](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/admin-roles.html), you have out-of-the box access to specific Experience Cloud products, such as Adobe Admin Console. However, to use products such as Permissions and Experience Platform, you are also required to give yourself administrator and user access to the Experience Platform product. This access allows you to use the product as well as grant and manage user access to your team. Follow the step-by-step guide below to give yourself administrative access to these products as a system admin.

Log in to [Adobe Experience Cloud](https://experience.adobe.com/) with your credentials. The home view displays with the **[!UICONTROL Quick access]** section providing access to your available products. To begin gaining access to Experience Platform and Permissions, select **[!UICONTROL Admin Console]**.

The [Adobe Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/) overview dashboard displays. Select **[!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Platform]** from the **[!UICONTROL Products]** list under **[!UICONTROL Products and services]**.

The Adobe Experience Plaform dashboard displays. Select the **[!UICONTROL Admins]** tab and then select **[!UICONTROL Add admin]**.

Return to Adobe Experience Cloud. You should now see **[!UICONTROL Experience Platform]** and **[!UICONTROL Permissions]** inside of **[!UICONTROL Quick access]**.

> The products can take several minutes to gain access to and you'll receive an email alerting you you've recieved access. If you're not seeing Experience Platform or Permissions in Adobe Experience Cloud after receiving the email, log out and then back in to your account.
