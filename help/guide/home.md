## Identify audiences through trusted partners

Publishers and advertisers can collaborate in a privacy-safe environment to match audiences, discover potential new customers, and maximize ad return on available inventory. The easy-to-use interface allows you to surface these audiences without relying on technical resources, connecting premium publishers and advertisers for data collaboration opportunities.

## Scale reach and deliver cross-channel campaigns

Publishers can securely access and activate advertiser audiences across multiple channels, scaling reach faster using identity partners and look-alike modeling (available in upcoming releases). Advertisers can guide audiences through the funnel and suppress already-converted audiences, ensuring message relevance and efficient spending through a secure activation workflow.

## Understand aggregate campaign performance

Use collaborative measurement tools to track the impact of your campaigns. Publishers can report campaign performance to brands, helping improve current and future ads. Advertisers can share privacy-safe engagement and conversion insights, integrate exposure, channel, and conversion data, and use preferred measurement partners for complete insights. Note that some of the measurement functionality is not available in the alpha release.

## Additional benefits

Embedded controls ensure governance and privacy requirements are met, guiding responsible use of audience data across partners.

### Agnostic and interoperable
