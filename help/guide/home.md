## Identify audiences through trusted partners

Collaborators can form connections in a privacy-centric environment to match audiences, discover potential new customers, and maximize ad return on available inventory. The easy-to-use interface allows you to surface these audiences in a no-code environment for seamless collaboration.

## Scale reach and deliver cross-channel campaigns

Collaborators can securely access and activate advertiser audiences across multiple channels to reach your target audience at scale, ensuring that your campaigns are effective and far-reaching. 

## Understand aggregate campaign performance

Use collaborative measurement tools to track the impact of your campaigns. Collaborators can report campaign performance to each other, helping improve current and future ads, and adjust ad spending. Share privacy-centric engagement and conversion insights, integrate exposure, channel, and conversion data, and use preferred measurement partners for complete insights. Note that some of the measurement automation is not available in the first release.

## Privacy-centric

Embedded controls ensure that governance and privacy requirements are met, guiding the responsible use of audience data at every step of your workflows.

## Get started {#get-started}

To begin using Collaboration, system administrators need to give themselves, product administrators, and end users access. There are multiple required steps dependent on the user and level of access required. Refer to the [access control overview](/help/guide/permissions/overview.md){target="_blank"} guide to get started.

Once you have access, you're ready to set up your account and create your data connection to being sourcing audiences. Read the [end-to-end workflow](/help/guide/overview/end-to-end-workflow.md) to get started.
