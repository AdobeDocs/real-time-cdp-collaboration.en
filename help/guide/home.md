## Identify audiences through trusted partners

You can collaborate with publishers and advertisers in a privacy-safe environment to match your audiences and discover potential new customers. The easy-to-use interface allows you to surface these audiences without relying on technical resources, connecting with premium publishers and global advertisers for data collaboration opportunities.

## Scale reach and deliver cross-channel campaigns

Publishers can securely access and activate advertiser segments across multiple channels, scaling reach faster using identity partners and look-alike modeling (available in upcoming releases). Advertisers can guide audiences through the funnel and suppress already-converted audiences, ensuring message relevance and efficient spending through a secure activation workflow.

## Understand aggregate campaign performance

Use collaborative measurement tools to track the impact of your campaigns. Publishers can report campaign performance to brands, helping improve current and future ads. Advertisers can share privacy-safe engagement and conversion insights, integrate exposure, channel, and conversion data, and use preferred measurement partners for complete insights.

## Additional benefits
