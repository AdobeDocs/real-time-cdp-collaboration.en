## Overview

## Identify audiences through trusted partners

Publishers and advertisers can collaborate in a privacy-safe environment to match audiences, discover potential new customers, and maximize ad return on available inventory. The easy-to-use interface allows you to surface these audiences in a no-code environment, connecting premium publishers and advertisers for data collaboration opportunities.

## Scale reach and deliver cross-channel campaigns

Publishers can securely access and activate advertiser audiences across multiple channels, scaling their reach faster using identity partners and look-alike modeling (available in upcoming releases). Advertisers can guide audiences through the funnel and suppress already-converted audiences, ensuring message relevance and efficient spending through a secure activation workflow.

## Understand aggregate campaign performance

Use collaborative measurement tools to track the impact of your campaigns. Publishers can report campaign performance to brands, helping improve current and future ads, and adjust ad spending. Advertisers can share privacy-safe engagement and conversion insights, integrate exposure, channel, and conversion data, and use preferred measurement partners for complete insights. Note that some of the measurement automation is not available in the first release.

## Privacy-focused

Embedded controls ensure that governance and privacy requirements are met, guiding the responsible use of audience data at every step of your workflows.

### Built-in reputation

Trusted by leading global brands, Adobe brings a strong foundation in identity, audience collaboration, and activation, offering closed-loop and marketer-friendly workflows for data collaboration.
