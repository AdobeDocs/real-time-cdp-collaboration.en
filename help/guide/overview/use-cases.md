# Collaboration use cases

{{limited-availability-release-note}}

Adobe Real-Time CDP Collaboration enables collaboration with advertisers and publishers, unlocking new opportunities for audience discovery, activation, and measurement. These connections enhance marketing strategies by leveraging shared data while maintaining privacy and security.

Collaboration provides three main use cases in your connections with other collaborators: Discover, Activate, and Measure. Each use case offers unique benefits and capabilities to enhance your marketing efforts. These uses cases are [selected when you create a project](../collaborate/manage-projects.md#project-use-cases) with a collaborator to kick off a campaign, and will determine the features and functionalities available in that project.

## Discover {#discover}

Discover target audiences for campaigns by leveraging the **[!UICONTROL Audience insights]** dashboard within your projects. Get insight into overlap percentages and the number of overlapping identities between your audiences and those of your collaborators. This helps you identify potential new audiences for your campaigns. To learn more about the power of the discover use case, refer to the [discover](../collaborate/discover.md) guide.

## Activate {#activate}

Collaborators can activate audiences to Experience Platform using self-serve [destinations](/help/guide/destinations/experience-platform.md) or cloud data warehouses (such as [!DNL Amazon S3] or [!DNL Snowflake]) for use in campaigns. To learn more about activating audiences, refer to the [activate](../collaborate/activate.md) guide.
