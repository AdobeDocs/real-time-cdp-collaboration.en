# End-to-end workflow

{{limited-availability-release-note}}

In Adobe Real-Time CDP Collaboration, the end-to-end workflow varies based on the collaboration pattern you choose. The workflow outlines the steps involved in setting up and executing a collaboration project, from creating accounts and sourcing audiences to forming connections and creating projects. Understanding this workflow is essential for effectively leveraging the platform's capabilities to achieve your marketing goals.

## Getting started

Before you begin, ensure you have a solid understanding of these key concepts:

- **Collaboration patterns**: These patterns define how collaborators work together. There are two distinct patterns: [advertiser-to-publisher](./collaboration-patterns.md#advertiser-to-publisher) and [brand-to-brand](./collaboration-patterns.md#brand-to-brand).
- **Account roles**: Account roles determine your capabilities within the platform. They should align with your organization's objectives, brand, and goals. There are two account roles: [advertiser](./roles.md#advertiser) and [publisher](./roles.md#publisher).
- **Use cases**: Uses cases define the ways you can leverage Collaboration to achieve your marketing objectives. There are three collaboration use cases: [discover](./use-cases.md#discover), [activate](./use-cases.md#activate), and [measure](./use-cases.md#measure).

<!-- This guide will use three mock collaborators to illustrate the end-to-end workflow:

- **Brand A**: An advertiser that wants to reach specific audiences through targeted marketing campaigns.
- **Brand B**: A publisher that owns an online platform and provides audience data for use by advertisers.
- **Brand C**: Another advertiser that collaborates with Brand A to share audience data and insights. -->

## Advertiser-to-publisher workflow {#advertiser-to-publisher-workflow}

<!-- The advertiser-to-publisher workflow is designed for scenarios where an advertiser collaborates with a publisher to access and utilize audience data for targeted marketing campaigns. This workflow typically involves the following steps:

1. **Create accounts**: The advertiser and publisher create their respective accounts in Adobe Real-Time CDP Collaboration, selecting the appropriate roles during the account creation process.
2. **Source audiences**: The publisher sources audiences from their online content or services, ensuring that personal data is collected with user consent.
3. **Form connections**: The advertiser and publisher establish a connection within the platform, allowing them to share audience data securely.
4. **Create projects**: The advertiser creates a project to define the objectives and parameters of the collaboration, such as targeting specific audience segments or measuring campaign effectiveness.
5. **Activate audiences**: The advertiser activates the sourced audiences for marketing campaigns, leveraging the insights gained from the publisher's data.
6. **Measure results**: After the campaigns are executed, the advertiser measures the results to evaluate the effectiveness of the collaboration and make data-driven decisions for future campaigns. -->

## Brand-to-brand workflow {#brand-to-brand-workflow}

<!-- The brand-to-brand workflow is designed for scenarios where two brands collaborate to share audience data and insights, enhancing their marketing efforts. This workflow typically involves the following steps:

1. **Create accounts**: Both brands create their respective accounts in Adobe Real-Time CDP Collaboration, selecting the appropriate roles during the account creation process.
2. **Source audiences**: Each brand sources audiences from their own platforms, ensuring that personal data is collected with user consent.
3. **Form connections**: The brands establish a connection within the platform, allowing them to share audience data securely.
4. **Create projects**: Each brand creates a project to define the objectives and parameters of the collaboration, such as targeting specific audience segments or measuring campaign effectiveness.
5. **Activate audiences**: The brands activate the sourced audiences for marketing campaigns, leveraging the insights gained from each other's data.
6. **Measure results**: After the campaigns are executed, each brand measures the results to evaluate the effectiveness of the collaboration and make data-driven decisions for future campaigns. -->
