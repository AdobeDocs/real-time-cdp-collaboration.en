# Adobe Real-Time CDP Collaboration Starter Overview

With Adobe Real-Time CDP Collaboration Starter, you can join and work with a licensed partner on privacy‑centric data collaboration without requiring your own Collaboration license.

Your licensed partner invites you into Collaboration and use their credits to fund your joint workflows, across both advertiser-to-publisher and brand-to-brand patterns. To learn more about these patterns and how they work, read the [collaboration patterns](./collaboration-patterns.md) and [end-to-end workflow](./end-to-end-workflow.md) guides.

As an invited Starter customer, you can:

* Onboard and manage collaboration data in a Starter account
* Source and maintain audiences for use in joint projects
* Gain insights into audience overlaps with your partner to support effective targeting and campaign measurement
* Activate audiences and share them back to your partner for joint campaign activation and engagement

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

To get started with Collaboration Starter, ensure that both your organization and your licensed partner are located in the same region. You must be invited by a partner who holds a Real-Time CDP Prime, Ultimate, or Collaboration license.

To initiate the invitation, provide the following information to your licensed partner:

* Contact name
* Contact email
* Company
* Role (Advertiser/Publisher): Advertiser
* Industry
* Admin name (if different from contact name)
* Admin contact email (if different from contact email)

After you receive and accept the invitation, your organization must review and sign a no-cost Sales Order with Adobe to access Collaboration Starter.
