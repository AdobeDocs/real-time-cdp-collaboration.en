# The collaboration patterns in Adobe Real-Time CDP Collaboration

{{limited-availability-release-note}}

Collaboration patterns in Adobe Real-Time CDP Collaboration are models that define how collaborators work together to achieve their marketing goals. There are two distinct collaboration patterns: Advertiser to Publisher, and Brand to Brand. Each pattern serves a specific purpose and is designed to facilitate effective collaboration between brands.

## Advertiser to Publisher

<!-- IMPROVE THIS, THATS JUST AI -->

In the Advertiser to Publisher collaboration pattern, advertisers work with publishers to access their audience data for targeted marketing campaigns. This pattern allows advertisers to leverage the rich insights and data provided by publishers to enhance their campaign strategies and reach their desired audiences more effectively.

## Brand to Brand

 <!-- IMPROVE THIS, THATS JUST AI -->

The Brand to Brand collaboration pattern enables brands to collaborate directly with each other, sharing audience data and insights to improve their marketing efforts. This pattern fosters a more integrated approach to audience targeting and campaign execution, allowing brands to work together to achieve common goals.
