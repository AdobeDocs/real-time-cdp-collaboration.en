# Collaboration patterns

{{limited-availability-release-note}}

Collaboration patterns in Adobe Real-Time CDP Collaboration are models that define how collaborators work together to achieve their marketing goals. There are two distinct collaboration patterns: advertiser-to-publisher, and brand-to-brand. Each pattern serves a specific purpose and is designed to facilitate effective collaboration between brands.

To learn more about the differences between advertisers and publishers, read the [roles](/help/guide/overview/roles.md) guide.

## Advertiser-to-publisher

In the advertiser-to-publisher collaboration pattern, advertisers aim to target and measure audiences in connection with publishers. This pattern allows advertisers to leverage publisher audiences to enhance their targeting capabilities, while publishers can provide valuable insights into audience behavior and preferences. Advertisers can optimize their campaigns by reaching the right audience at the right time while publishers gain access to advertiser data, which helps them better understand their audiences to improve their content offerings.

## Brand-to-brand

>[!NOTE]
>
>A brand is a company or organization that is involved in marketing and advertising, and can be either an advertiser or a publisher.

The brand-to-brand collaboration pattern enables brands to collaborate directly with each other to identify and target audiences for joint marketing efforts. This pattern is useful for brands that want to expand their reach and engage with new audiences through brand partnerships. By working together, brands can leverage each other's audience insights to create co-marketing and loyalty campaigns that benefit both collaborators and their customers.
