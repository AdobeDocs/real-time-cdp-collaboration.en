# Collaborator account roles

{{limited-availability-release-note}}

In Adobe Real-Time CDP Collaboration, there are two roles associated with accounts: an **advertiser** and a **publisher**. Roles are chosen during the account creation process and should reflect the intent of that account.

## Advertiser {#advertiser}

Advertisers are brands that seek to reach specific audiences through targeted marketing campaigns. They will invest in marketing to reach audiences alongside their collaborators to improve brand awareness, prospecting, re-engagement, and conversions. Using Collaboration, advertisers can leverage audience insights from their connections to enhance their marketing strategies and achieve their goals.

## Publisher {#publisher}

Publishers are brands that own or operate online content or services where personal data is collected with user consent. They provide this data for use by advertisers for digital advertising and audience measurement. Using Collaboration, publishers can send their audience data to collaborators to enable targeted marketing campaigns and improve the effectiveness of their advertising efforts.

## Choosing the right role {#choosing-the-right-role}

When creating an account in Adobe Real-Time CDP Collaboration, it is essential to select the role that best fits your organization's objectives. There are cases where brands may fit both roles, since a brand may operate an online platform (publisher) and also runs marketing campaigns (advertiser). While Collaboration allows for flexibility through its collaboration patterns, it is recommended to choose the role that aligns with your primary goal.

To get a clearer understanding of the roles, of the different collaboration patterns, and how they can be used, refer to the [collaboration patterns](/help/guide/overview/collaboration-patterns.md) guide. Our [end-to-end workflow](/help/guide/overview/end-to-end-workflow.md) guide highlights each collaboration pattern and provides a general overview of Collaboration product through the lens of a brand.
