# Manage connections {#manage-connections}

{{limited-availability-release-note}}

The **[!UICONTROL My connections]** workspace provides a centralized location for managing your connections. You can view existing connections in the **[!UICONTROL Existing connections]** section and see any connections that require action in the **[!UICONTROL Action required]** section.

## View connection {#view-connection}

To view your existing connections, navigate to the **[!UICONTROL Connect]** workspace. As a publisher, your existing connection will be displayed. As an advertiser, you should then navigate to **[!UICONTROL My connections]**.

The connection settings workspace appears, displaying the connection details between you and your collaborator. Here, you can view all the settings selected during the connection process, the current status of the connection, the connection owner, and the contact information for your collaborator. For information on specific connection settings, see the [connection settings](/help/guide/connect/establishing-connections.md#connection-settings) guide.

## Delete connection {#delete-connection}

You can delete any connections with collaborators that you do not want to continue working with. To delete a connection, navigate to the connection you wish to delete and then select the delete icon ![delete icon](/help/assets/common/delete.svg) in the connection workspace.

A confirmation dialog appears, asking you to confirm the deletion of the connection. Select **[!UICONTROL Delete]** to confirm the deletion.

>[!WARNING]
>
>Once the connection is deleted, all existing projects in the collaboration will be permanently deleted and unrecoverable. The connection request will remain in a pending state within the **[!UICONTROL Action required]** section within **[!UICONTROL My connections]**, but the connection and its configurations will no longer be active. You will need to re-establish the connection if you want to connect with the collaborator again.
