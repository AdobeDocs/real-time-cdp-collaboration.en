# Discover publishers

{{limited-availability-release-note}}

Discover and connect with potential publishers in Adobe Real-Time CDP Collaboration. This guide provides insights on how to identify ideal collaborators and leverage their audiences to enhance your marketing campaigns.

To discover publishers, go to the **[!UICONTROL Connect]** > **[!UICONTROL Discover publishers]** tab.

Select **[!UICONTROL View publisher]** to learn more about the publisher. You can also view and inspect any audiences that the publisher [set as public](/help/guide/setup/onboard-audiences.md#metadata-visibility).

## My connections

The **[!UICONTROL My connections]** workspace provides an overview of your connections and highlights any actions required on your part.

Under **[!UICONTROL Action required]**, you can see a list of all connections where an invite has been sent but the connection has not been established yet. An action might be required, from you or your collaborator. 

![Action required view in the My connections screen](/help/assets/connect/discover-publishers/action-required-view.png){zoomable="yes"}

Some reasons why a connection is displayed in the **[!UICONTROL Action required]** view are:

* Your account has sent a connection invite to a collaborator and you are waiting for them to accept. At this point, you can preview the [connection settings](/help/guide/glossary.md#connection-settings) that you can later submit to the prospective collaborator.
* Your account has sent a connection invite to a collaborator and they have accepted it. At this point, you can proceed and set up the connection settings and submit them to the collaborator for approval.
* Your account has sent connection settings to the collaborator and you are waiting on them to accept or reject the proposed connection settings.
* Your account has sent connection settings to the collaborator and they have rejected your proposal. You can now revise the connection settings and resend.

In the **[!UICONTROL Existing connections]** view, you can explore existing connections with collaborators and proceed to create projects to start collaborating on campaigns.
