# Establishing connections

{{limited-availability-release-note}}

Before collaborators can work together on campaigns, they must establish a connection. This connection allows them to activate audiences, create projects, and run reports on campaign performance.

Connections are established based on your chosen collaboration pattern. Collaboration supports two key collaboration patterns: advertiser-to-publisher and brand-to-brand. To read more about these patterns, see the [use cases and benefits](/help/guide/use-cases-benefits.md) guide.

<!-- REPLACE THE LINK ABOVE WITH THE CORRECT LINK AFTER PAGE IS ESTABLISHED -->

To learn how to establish a connection, read the section below that corresponds to your collaboration pattern:

- [Advertiser-to-publisher connection](#advertiser-to-publisher-connection)
- [Brand-to-brand connection](#brand-to-brand-connection)

## Advertiser-to-publisher connection {#advertiser-to-publisher-connection}

![High-level diagram of the advertiser-publisher connection process.](/help/assets/connect/establish-connection/advertiser-publisher-flow.png){zoomable="yes"}

In the advertiser-to-publisher pattern, an advertiser discovers a publisher they want to work with through the **[!UICONTROL Discover publishers]** workspace and sends a connection invite. The publisher then reviews the invite and accepts it, allowing the advertiser to propose connection settings. Once the publisher accepts the connection settings, the connection is established, and both collaborators can begin working together on projects.

### High-level overview 

To establish a connection between an advertiser and a publisher, the following steps are involved:

1. [Discover publishers](#discover-publishers): The advertiser identifies potential publishers to collaborate with.
2. [Send invite](#send-invite): The advertiser sends a connection invite to the selected publisher.
3. [Accept invite](#accept-invite): The publisher reviews and accepts the invite.
4. [Configure connection settings](#configure-connection-settings): The advertiser configures the connection settings and sends them to the publisher for review.
5. [Confirm connection settings](#establish-connection): The publisher reviews the connection settings and either accepts or rejects them. If accepted, the connection is established. If rejected, the publisher can provide feedback for revisions outside the product. The advertiser can then revise the settings and resend them for review.

Once the connection settings are accepted, the connection is established, and collaborators are ready to [create a project](/help/guide/collaborate/manage-projects.md#create-project) to begin collaborating on campaigns.

## Brand-to-brand connection {#brand-to-brand-connection}

![High-level diagram of the brand-to-brand connection process.](/help/assets/connect/establish-connection/brand-to-brand-flow.png){zoomable="yes"}

>[!TIP]
>
>The term **brand** is used to refer a company or brand outside of Collaboration. The term **collaborator** refers to any account that can form a connection in Collaboration, regardless of whether they are an advertiser or a publisher.

In the brand-to-brand pattern, two brands that have communicated outside of the product can connect directly in Collaboration using a [private connection invite](#private-connection-invite). A brand can be either an advertiser or a publisher. This pattern is particularly useful for brands that may not fit the traditional advertiser-publisher model, such as two advertisers or two publishers.

To begin, a collaborator sends a private connection invite to another collaborator. The recipient reviews the invite and accepts it, allowing the owner to propose connection settings. Once the recipient accepts the connection settings, the connection is established, and both collaborators can start working together on projects.

### High-level overview

>[!TIP]
>
>When discussing the connection process, there will be a distinction between the **owner** and the **recipient**. The owner is the collaborator who initiates the connection by sending the invite, while the recipient is the collaborator who receives and reviews the invite.

The connection process between two brands involves several steps. Before the connection process begins, a few prerequisites must be met:

1. Two brands communicate outside of the product to discuss the potential connection. 
2. The brands [create accounts](/help/guide/setup/onboard-account.md) in Collaboration if they haven't already, being sure to select the appropriate role type (advertiser or publisher).
   
Once the prerequisites are met, the connection process can begin. The following steps outline the process:

1. [Send private connection invite](#send-private-connection-invite): One collaborator sends a private connection invite to another collaborator.
2. [Accept private connection invite](#accept-private-connection-invite): The recipient reviews and accepts the private connection invite.
3. [Configure connection settings](#configure-connection-settings): The owner configures the connection settings and sends them to the recipient for review and acceptance.
4. [Confirm connection settings](#establish-connection): The recipient reviews the connection settings and either accepts or rejects them.

Once the connection settings are accepted, the connection is established, and collaborators are ready to [create a project](/help/guide/collaborate/manage-projects.md#create-project) to begin collaborating on campaigns.

## Connect {#connect} 

The **[!UICONTROL Connect]** workspace is where you can manage your connections with collaborators, send connection invites, and where advertisers can browse the publisher directory. The workspace is divided into two main tabs:

### Discover publishers {#discover-publishers}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Only advertisers can discover publishers using the **[!UICONTROL Discover publishers]** workspace. To learn about connecting with collaborators regardless of their role, read the [brand-to-brand connection](#brand-to-brand-connection) section.

To discover publishers, navigate to the **[!UICONTROL Discover publishers]** workspace in the **[!UICONTROL Connect]** tab. Here, you can browse through the list of available publishers using the pagination controls at the bottom of the workspace. To learn more about the **[!UICONTROL Discover publishers]** workspace, see the [discover publishers](/help/guide/connect/discover-publishers.md) guide.

![The Discover publishers workspace displaying a list of available publishers.](/help/assets/connect/establish-connection/discover-publishers.png){zoomable="yes"}

### Send invite {#send-invite}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This section describes the process of advertisers sending connection invites to publishers through the **[!UICONTROL Discover publishers]** workspace. To learn about forming connections between brands regardless of their roles, read the [brand-to-brand connection](#brand-to-brand-connection) section or visit the [private connection invite](#private-connection-invite) section.

Once you've identified a publisher you want to collaborate with, select the **[!UICONTROL Connect]** option on the publisher card. This action initiates the connection process.

![The Connect option highlighted on a specific publisher in the Discover publishers workspace.](/help/assets/connect/establish-connection/connect-selection.png){zoomable="yes"}

A dialog appears, prompting you to send a connection invite to the publisher. Select **[!UICONTROL Send invite]** to proceed.

![The Send connection invite dialog with the Send invite button highlighted.](/help/assets/connect/establish-connection/send-connection-invite-dialog.png){zoomable="yes"}

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you wish to connect with a publisher you've communicated with outside of the product, you can utilize the private connection invite option. To learn more, see the [private connection invite](#private-connection-invite) section.

The pending invite is displayed in the **[!UICONTROL My connections]** tab in the **[!UICONTROL Action required]** section. The connection status appears as **[!UICONTROL Invite sent]**. You can preview the connection settings by selecting **[!UICONTROL Preview connection]**, but you cannot edit them until the publisher accepts the invite.

![The pending connection is displayed in the My connections workspace in the Action required section.](/help/assets/connect/establish-connection/preview-connection.png){zoomable="yes"}

### Private connection invite {#private-connection-invite}

Private connection invites allow you to connect with collaborators you've communicated with outside of the product using a **[!UICONTROL Connect code]**. To form a private connection, you need to obtain the **[!UICONTROL Connect code]** from the collaborator you want to connect with outside of the product. You can then use this code to send a private connection invite to the collaborator in the **[!UICONTROL Connect]** workspace.

#### Connect code {#connect-code}

Before you can send a private connection invite, your desired collaborator must provide you their unique **[!UICONTROL Connect code]**. To find and copy your **[!UICONTROL Connect code]**, navigate to the **[!UICONTROL My account]** tab within in the **[!UICONTROL Setup]** workspace. The **[!UICONTROL Connect code]** is displayed within your account details.

![The My account tab within the Setup workspace with the Connect code highlighted.](/help/assets/connect/establish-connection/connect-code.png){zoomable="yes"}

Select the copy icon (![copy icon](/help/assets/icons/copy.png)) next to the **[!UICONTROL Connect code]** to copy it to your clipboard. You can then share this code with your collaborator outside of the product.

![The Connect code with the copy icon highlighted.](/help/assets/connect/establish-connection/copy-connect-code.png){zoomable="yes"}

##### Refreshing the connect code {#refresh-connect-code}

You can refresh your **[!UICONTROL Connect code]** at any time. Refreshing the code generates a new unique code that you can share with collaborators. This is useful if you want to invalidate the previous code for security reasons. Any connections established using the old code will remain active, but new collaborators will need to use the new code to connect with you.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Refreshing your **[!UICONTROL Connect code]** during a pending invite may prevent the invite from being accepted. If you refresh your code, your collaborator may need to resend the private connection invite using the new code.

To refresh your **[!UICONTROL Connect code]**, select the refresh icon (![refresh icon](/help/assets/icons/refresh.png)) next to the **[!UICONTROL Connect code]**.

![The Connect code with the refresh icon highlighted.](/help/assets/connect/establish-connection/refresh-connect-code.png){zoomable="yes"}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Any accounts created before the **[!UICONTROL Connect code]** feature was introduced will not have a generated connect code, and the connect field will show as **[!UICONTROL Unavailable]**. Use the refresh option to generate a new connect code.

#### Send private connection invite {#send-private-connection-invite}

Once you have the **[!UICONTROL Connect code]** from your collaborator, you can send a private connection invite. To do this, navigate to the **[!UICONTROL Connect]** workspace and select the plus icon (![plus icon](/help/assets/icons/plus.png)) in the upper right corner.

![The plus icon highlighted in the Connect workspace.](/help/assets/connect/establish-connection/private-connection-invite.png){zoomable="yes"}

The **[!UICONTROL Connect]** dialog appears, prompting you to enter the **[!UICONTROL Connect code]** of the collaborator you want to connect with. Paste the code into the text field and select **[!UICONTROL Continue]** to proceed.

![The Connect dialog with the Connect code field filled in and the Continue option highlighted.](/help/assets/connect/establish-connection/private-connection-invite-connect.png){zoomable="yes"}

The **[!UICONTROL Connect]** dialog will then display the collaborator the code is associated with, allowing you to confirm that you are connecting with the correct collaborator. If the collaborator is correct, select **[!UICONTROL Connect]** to send the private connection invite.

![The Connect dialog with the collaborator details displayed and the Connect option highlighted.](/help/assets/connect/establish-connection/private-connection-invite-connect-confirm.png){zoomable="yes"}

### Accept invite {#accept-invite}

>[!TIP]
>
>When discussing the connection process, there will be a distinction between the **owner** and the **recipient**. The owner is the collaborator who initiates the connection by sending the invite, while the recipient is the collaborator who receives and reviews the invite.

Before the owner can configure the connection settings, the recipient must accept the connection invite. To do this, navigate to the **[!UICONTROL Connect]** workspace and find the pending connection in the **[!UICONTROL Action required]** section. The connection status appears as **[!UICONTROL Invite received]**. Select **[!UICONTROL Accept]** to accept the invite.

![The pending connection is displayed Action required section of the Connect workspace with the Accept option highlighted.](/help/assets/connect/establish-connection/accept-connection.png){zoomable="yes"}

The dialog appears prompting you to accept the invite. Select **[!UICONTROL Accept invite]** to proceed.

![The Accept connection invite dialog with the Accept invite option highlighted.](/help/assets/connect/establish-connection/accept-connection-invite.png){zoomable="yes"}

The status of the connection changes to **[!UICONTROL Pending]**. The owner can now configure the connection settings.

### Configure connection settings {#configure-connection-settings}

The connection settings define the terms between two collaborators. These settings include use cases, match keys, credit split, and legal agreements. Collaborators connecting with advertisers can also add advertiser names to the connection settings, which will be used when creating projects.

![The connection settings view in the preview state.](/help/assets/connect/establish-connection/preview-connection-settings.png){zoomable="yes"}

After the recipient accepts the invite, the owner can configure the connection settings. To do this, navigate to **[!UICONTROL My connections]** and find the pending connection in the **[!UICONTROL Action required]** section. Select **[!UICONTROL Set up connection]** to configure the connection settings.

![The Connect workspace with the Set up connection option highlighted in the Action required section.](/help/assets/connect/establish-connection/pending-connection.png){zoomable="yes"}

The connection settings workspace appears, allowing you to configure the various settings for the connection.

You can configure the following connection settings:

+++Use cases

Use cases are automatically populated with all available options. Selected use cases determine which views and options are available within your projects. To learn more, read the [project use cases](/help/guide/collaborate/manage-projects.md#project-use-cases) guide.

To customize your use cases, select **[!UICONTROL Edit]** in the **[!UICONTROL Use cases]** section and turn off any you don't wish to include in any projects with your collaborator. When you're done, select **[!UICONTROL Save]** to save your changes.

![The Use cases settings in the connection settings workspace.](/help/assets/connect/establish-connection/view-use-cases.png){zoomable="yes"}

+++

+++Match keys

Match keys are automatically populated with the ones you selected while [setting up your account](/help/guide/setup/onboard-account.md#set-up-match-keys). You can toggle off any match keys you don't want to use, but you can't add match keys that weren't selected during account setup.

To customize your match keys, select **[!UICONTROL Edit]** in the **[!UICONTROL Match keys]** section and toggle off any match keys you don't want to use in this connection. When you're done, select **[!UICONTROL Save]** to save your changes.

![The Match key settings in the connection settings workspace.](/help/assets/connect/establish-connection/match-keys.png){zoomable="yes"}

+++

+++Credit split

Use the credit split section to determine which of the two collaborating parties will cover the costs for the activities. Credit split options are determined by the selected use cases for the connection. While the **[!UICONTROL Measurement]** use case requires one party to cover the costs, the **[!UICONTROL Activation - Matching]** use case gives an additional option to have each party cover their own costs. For information on the breakdown of costs, read the [credit activity types](/help/guide/setup/my-activity.md#types-of-activities) guide.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Audience - Egress is always covered by the the collaborator that receives the audience, therefore no selection is required.

To set up the credit split, select **[!UICONTROL Edit]** in the **[!UICONTROL Credit split]** section. You can then select the appropriate options for each use case. When you're done, select **[!UICONTROL Save]** to save your changes.

![The Credit split dialog with options in the connection settings workspace.](/help/assets/connect/establish-connection/credit-split.png){zoomable="yes"}
+++

+++Agreements

You must acknowledge that a legal agreement is in place between you and your collaborator. This agreement outlines the terms of data sharing and collaboration. You can select the **[!UICONTROL Acknowledge and confirm]** checkbox to confirm that such an agreement exists. 

![The Legal agreement section highlight and confirmed in the connection workspace.](/help/assets/connect/establish-connection/legal-agreement.png){zoomable="yes"}

+++

+++Advertiser names

>[!NOTE]
>
>This option may appear during the connection settings configuration or the review of the connection settings, depending on the who initiates the connection.

If you are a publisher forming a connection with an advertiser, you can choose to add advertiser names in the connection settings. This allows you to add multiple names by which the advertiser is known to you in your systems. This is particularly useful if the advertiser has a presence in multiple geographies or if they are known by different names in different contexts. Later, when you create a project, you can select the appropriate advertiser name from the list of names configured in the connection settings.

![The Advertiser names dialog in the connection settings workspace.](/help/assets/connect/establish-connection/add-advertiser-names-modal.png)

Here's how the advertiser name selection works when creating a project:

1. **No advertiser name set**: If no advertiser names are added, Collaboration defaults to using the advertiser's name as the advertiser name.
2. **One advertiser name set**: If a single advertiser name is added, Collaboration automatically uses that name as the advertiser name for the project.
3. **Multiple advertiser names set**: If more than one advertiser name is added, you or your collaborator can select any of the provided names when creating the project.

>[!NOTE]
>
> Once you've sent the connection settings, you are no longer able to add or edit advertiser names.

![The connection settings workspace with the Advertiser names section filled in.](/help/assets/connect/establish-connection/advertiser-names.png)

+++

After you have made your selections, select **[!UICONTROL Submit]** to send the suggested settings to the recipient for review.

### Review connection settings {#review-connection-settings}

Next, the recipient needs to review the connection settings proposed by the owner. The recipient can do this by navigating to the **[!UICONTROL My connections]** tab in the **[!UICONTROL Connect]** workspace. The connection will be displayed in the **[!UICONTROL Action required]** section. Select **[!UICONTROL Review connection settings]** to review the proposed connection settings.

![The My connections workspace with the Review connection settings option highlighted.](/help/assets/connect/establish-connection/review-connection-settings.png){zoomable="yes"}

Review the settings the collaborator has proposed. You can either accept or reject the connection settings. If you reject the connection settings, you'll need to communicate with the collaborator about the changes you want made outside the product. The collaborator's contact information is displayed in the **[!UICONTROL Contact]** section of the connection settings workspace. The owner can then revise the connection settings and resend them for review.

If you are satisfied with the proposed connection settings, you must acknowledge that a legal agreement is in place between you and the collaborator. Select the **[!UICONTROL Acknowledge and confirm]** checkbox to confirm that such an agreement exists. 

![The Legal agreement section highlighted in the connection settings workspace.](/help/assets/connect/establish-connection/legal-agreement-review.png){zoomable="yes"}

Additionally, if you're a publisher connecting with an advertiser, you can now add advertiser names in the connection settings. To learn more about this process, see the [connection settings](#connection-settings) section.

>[!NOTE]
>
> Once you've accepted the connection settings, you are no longer able to add or edit advertiser names.

Next, select **[!UICONTROL Accept]** to proceed with the connection. The connection status will change to **[!UICONTROL Active]**, and you can now start collaborating on projects.

## Delete connections {#delete-connections}

You can delete any connections with collaborators that you do not want to continue working with. To delete existing connections, navigate to **[!UICONTROL Connect]**. As a publisher, your existing connection will be displayed. As an advertiser, you should then navigate to **[!UICONTROL My connections]**. 

Select **[!UICONTROL View connection]** on the connection card you want to delete.

![The View connection option highlighted in the My connections view.](/help/assets/connect/establish-connection/delete-view-connection.png){zoomable="yes"}

Select the delete icon ![delete icon](/help/assets/common/delete.svg) in the connection workspace to delete the connection.

![The delete icon highlighted in the connection workspace.](/help/assets/connect/establish-connection/delete-option.png){zoomable="yes"}

A confirmation dialog appears, asking you to confirm the deletion of the connection. Select **[!UICONTROL Delete]** to confirm the deletion.

![The confirmation dialog to delete a connection.](/help/assets/connect/establish-connection/delete-confirmation-dialog.png){zoomable="yes"}

>[!WARNING]
>
>Once the connection is deleted, you will no longer be connected with the collaborator and all existing projects that are part of the collaboration will be permanently deleted and unrecoverable. 

## Next steps

After establishing a connection with your collaborator, you and your collaborator can now [create projects](/help/guide/collaborate/manage-projects.md#create-project).
